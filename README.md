# Whats this?
It's an "Flow Pomodoro" timer. The idea is to keep a distraction free environment.
The main functionalities are this:
- Stablish times for WORK and RELAX in order to achieve "Flow Satate"
- Play lofi/instrumental music from Spotify according to the genres selected
- Keep a task queue to remid user of WORKING BY OBJECTIVES

## Tech used
This is the frontend repo, but the idea is to integrate
- React for Front
- FastAPI or Flask for Back
- MongoDB
( Maybe something for oAuth)

## Ideas for the future
- Add something like trello but focused in improving ("Daily productivity on tasks")
- Divide time in work tasks and rest goals. Reast goals meaning things you want to do

- Somehow add videos that support app methods
